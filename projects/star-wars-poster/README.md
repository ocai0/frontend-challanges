# Star Wars Poster UI Idea

<div style="width: 100%; height: 10vmin; display: block; position: relative; margin: 0 0 1em; background: url(assets/imgs/stars.jpg) repeat; background-size: 40%">
    <h2 style="width: 100%; height: 100%; display: flex; align-items: center; justify-content: center">
        <a style="color: white" href="https://ocai0.github.io/frontend-challenges/star-wars-poster/dist/">See This Project LIVE NOW</a>
    </h2>
</div>

While i was watching [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mBxfiqQ3lQ) from the Brazilian Youtuber Felipe Castanhari, my attention got caughted by a [little UI](https://youtu.be/6mBxfiqQ3lQ?t=1502) showing all the Star Wars films of the first two trilogies (by the time this video was made, *Star Wars - The Force Awakens* hasn't been launched yet). And i thought it could be interesting to recreate this little UI with some React and TailwindCSS and it turns it out a very cool beginner exercise.

[You can see the final result here](https://ocai0.github.io/frontend-challenges/star-wars-poster/dist/), or you can look around the source code that i've done.
