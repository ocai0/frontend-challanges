# Front End Challenges
You can see here some of my projects with a more focus on the Front End part of things. Each project will have a proper **README.md** file into the folder, explaining more about the project
### **Index**

- [Favorite Albums Gallery](./projects/galeria-albuns) (Note: It's Currently in Portuguese)
- [News Site 'Lanterna'](./projects/noticias-lanterna) (Note: It's Currently in Portuguese)
- [Personal/Curriculum website](./projects/perfil-curriculo) (Note: It's Currently in Portuguese)


## Comming Up

 - [ ] Translate the older projects **README** to English
 - [ ] Normalize the way a **README** project file is written
 - [ ] Update Project ['Lanterna'](./projects/noticias-lanterna/)
